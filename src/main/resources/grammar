// Grammar reference for Kix (just for ref, not used to generate anything)

// First, we define some terms:
Literal:           Number, Strings, Booleans and nil
Unary Expression:  Prefix ! to perform logical not, and - to negate a number
Binary Expression: Infix arithmetic (+, -, *, /) and logic (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=)
Parenthesis:       Pair of ( and ) wrapped around an expression

// Now, the grammar production rules
expression      -> literal
                 | unary
                 | binary
                 | grouping ;

literal         -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil" ;

grouping        -> "(" expression ")" ;

unary           -> ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;

binary          -> expression operator expression ;

operator        -> "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "+" | "-" | "*" | "/" ;
